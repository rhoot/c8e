CHIP-8 overdraw test
====================

This program draws an 8x8 pixel square at 60x28, meaning it overflows 4 pixels
in each direction. The correct behavior is to wrap to the other side. So the
correct behavior when running this program is that you see a 4x4 pixel square
in each of the four corners of the screen.

If that is not the case, your emulator is not correctly wrapping pixels when
drawing.
